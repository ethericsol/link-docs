Obtain LINK
###########

In order to publish content on the Link network, or execute any kind of transaction, you must spend some LINK. LINK can be obtained either by mining it or by purchasing it.

You need to have a Link account. If you do not have one already, go to the Link console and run ``personal.newAccount();``.

Alternatively an Ethereum account can be created with `MyEtherWallet <https://www.myetherwallet.com/>`_ and that can be used for Link.

CPU Mining
##########

CPU mining with Geth is very easy. Run the regular Geth command, but add the ``--mine`` option. Use ``--etherbase`` to specify which account will receive the mining rewards. It defaults to using all processor cores. This can be changed using the ``--minerthreads`` option.

GPU Mining

Purchase LINK
-------------
LINK from the revenue smart contract will be sold on exchanges once they support it. Until then, LINK can be purchased directly.

If you wish to purchase LINK please email purchase@link-blockchain.org. It is currently available at a price of 0.01 USD per LINK. This price is subject to change at any time. Payment can be made via any cryptocurrency.
